## How to run
```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```
## How to test (HTTP client)

- Request file: scratch.http
- Env: http-client.env.json
- Local run:

```

## Technical problems & how I solved them

# Frontend
Not having done anything frontend related since DAT108, this was somewhat unusual for me and took some time getting used to.

# Connection
Integrating frontend and backend was a bit of a challenge, and I chose to split responsibilities into different scripts. One for clean calls to the backend, one for mounting it and the svelte file for logic and tying it all together.

# Tools
For solving this I relied on videos from lectures, online guides and AI tools.

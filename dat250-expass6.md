# DAT250 â€“ Experiment Assignment 6 (Poll App)

**Repo:** https://github.com/SeverinJo/poll-app  
**Report:** this file (`dat250-expass6.md`)

## What I did
Implemented a RabbitMQ messaging system for the Poll Application. The purpose of the messaging system was to notify users of new votes on polls they subscribe to.

## How to test
./gradle bootRun
run messaging.http

##  Problems & how I solved them

# Getting used to new tech
Reading the tutorials and understanding this new software, as well as getting it up and running with docker took some time before figuring it out and getting it to work.

# Testing
Another challenge was setting up a system to test that messages are received and in the correct format. This was done with the messaging.http scratch. 

# Tools
For solving this I relied on code examples from lectures, online documentation and AI tools.
